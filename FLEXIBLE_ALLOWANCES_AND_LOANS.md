# Flexible Allowances and Loans System

## Overview
Implemented a **flexible allowance and loan management system** that allows each employee to have different allowances and loans with individual enable/disable controls. This system mirrors the Excel file structure where each employee can have different combinations of allowances and loans.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Individual Control**
- **Per-Employee Settings**: Each employee can have different allowances enabled/disabled
- **Flexible Amounts**: Different amounts for each allowance per employee
- **Dynamic Loans**: Vehicle and company loans can be enabled/disabled individually
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in payroll calculations

### 📊 **Excel File Compatibility**
Based on the analysis of `Master_File_July-2025.xlsx`, the system now supports:
- **Conveyance Allowance**: Variable amounts per employee
- **House Rent Allowance**: Variable amounts per employee  
- **Food Allowance**: Variable amounts per employee
- **Vehicle & Fuel Allowance**: Variable amounts per employee
- **Medical Allowance**: Variable amounts per employee
- **Company Loan**: Variable amounts per employee
- **Vehicle Loan**: Variable amounts per employee
- **Arrears**: Backdated payments

## Database Schema

### Employee Model (`server/models/hr/Employee.js`)

#### Flexible Allowance Structure:
```javascript
allowances: {
  conveyance: {
    isActive: Boolean,    // Enable/disable for this employee
    amount: Number        // Amount for this employee
  },
  houseRent: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  food: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  vehicleFuel: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  medical: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  special: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  other: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  }
}
```

#### Loan Structure:
```javascript
loans: {
  vehicleLoan: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number,
    monthlyInstallment: Number,
    outstandingBalance: Number,
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  },
  companyLoan: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number,
    monthlyInstallment: Number,
    outstandingBalance: Number,
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  }
}
```

### Payroll Model (`server/models/hr/Payroll.js`)

#### Flexible Payroll Allowances:
```javascript
allowances: {
  conveyance: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  houseRent: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  food: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  vehicleFuel: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  medical: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  special: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  },
  other: {
    isActive: Boolean,
    amount: Number
  }
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### EmployeeForm (`client/src/pages/HR/EmployeeForm.js`)

#### Allowance Management Section:
```javascript
{/* Flexible Allowances Section */}
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
    Allowances Management
  </Typography>
</Grid>

{/* Each Allowance with Toggle */}
<Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
  <FormControl fullWidth>
    <FormControlLabel
      control={
        <Switch
          checked={formik.values.allowances?.conveyance?.isActive || false}
          onChange={(e) => formik.setFieldValue('allowances.conveyance.isActive', e.target.checked)}
        />
      }
      label="Conveyance Allowance"
    />
  </FormControl>
</Grid>

{/* Conditional Amount Field */}
{formik.values.allowances?.conveyance?.isActive && (
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
    <TextField
      fullWidth
      name="allowances.conveyance.amount"
      label="Conveyance Allowance Amount"
      type="number"
      value={formik.values.allowances?.conveyance?.amount || ''}
      onChange={formik.handleChange}
    />
  </Grid>
)}
```

#### Loan Management Sections:
```javascript
{/* Vehicle Loan Section */}
<Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
  <FormControl fullWidth>
    <FormControlLabel
      control={
        <Switch
          checked={formik.values.loans?.vehicleLoan?.isActive || false}
          onChange={(e) => formik.setFieldValue('loans.vehicleLoan.isActive', e.target.checked)}
        />
      }
      label="Vehicle Loan Active"
    />
  </FormControl>
</Grid>

{/* Conditional Loan Fields */}
{formik.values.loans?.vehicleLoan?.isActive && (
  <>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <TextField name="loans.vehicleLoan.amount" label="Vehicle Loan Amount" />
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <TextField name="loans.vehicleLoan.monthlyInstallment" label="Monthly Installment" />
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <TextField name="loans.vehicleLoan.outstandingBalance" label="Outstanding Balance" />
    </Grid>
  </>
)}
```

### PayrollForm (`client/src/pages/HR/PayrollForm.js`)

#### Enhanced Validation Schema:
```javascript
allowances: Yup.object({
  conveyance: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Conveyance allowance must be positive')
  }),
  houseRent: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'House rent allowance must be positive')
  }),
  food: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Food allowance must be positive')
  }),
  vehicleFuel: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Vehicle & fuel allowance must be positive')
  }),
  medical: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Medical allowance must be positive')
  }),
  special: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Special allowance must be positive')
  }),
  other: Yup.object({
    isActive: Yup.boolean(),
    amount: Yup.number().min(0, 'Other allowance must be positive')
  })
})
```

## Calculation Logic

### Payroll Calculations

#### Total Allowances Calculation:
```javascript
payrollSchema.virtual('totalAllowances').get(function() {
  let total = 0;
  
  if (this.allowances) {
    if (this.allowances.conveyance?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.conveyance.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.houseRent?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.houseRent.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.food?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.food.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.vehicleFuel?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.vehicleFuel.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.medical?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.medical.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.special?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.special.amount || 0;
    }
    if (this.allowances.other?.isActive) {
      total += this.allowances.other.amount || 0;
    }
  }
  
  return total;
});
```

#### Tax Calculation:
```javascript
const taxableIncome = calculateTaxableIncome({
  basic: this.basicSalary,
  allowances: {
    housing: this.allowances?.houseRent?.isActive ? this.allowances.houseRent.amount : 0,
    transport: this.allowances?.conveyance?.isActive ? this.allowances.conveyance.amount : 0,
    meal: this.allowances?.food?.isActive ? this.allowances.food.amount : 0,
    vehicleFuel: this.allowances?.vehicleFuel?.isActive ? this.allowances.vehicleFuel.amount : 0,
    other: this.allowances?.other?.isActive ? this.allowances.other.amount : 0,
    medical: this.allowances?.medical?.isActive ? this.allowances.medical.amount : 0
  }
});
```

### Payroll Generation

#### Employee Allowance Processing:
```javascript
// Get employee allowances (only active ones)
const employeeAllowances = employee.allowances || {};
const payrollAllowances = {
  conveyance: {
    isActive: employeeAllowances.conveyance?.isActive || false,
    amount: employeeAllowances.conveyance?.isActive ? employeeAllowances.conveyance.amount : 0
  },
  houseRent: {
    isActive: employeeAllowances.houseRent?.isActive || false,
    amount: employeeAllowances.houseRent?.isActive ? employeeAllowances.houseRent.amount : 0
  },
  // ... other allowances
};

// Calculate gross salary (basic + all active allowances)
const totalAllowances = Object.values(payrollAllowances).reduce((sum, allowance) => {
  return sum + (allowance.isActive ? allowance.amount : 0);
}, 0);

const grossSalary = basicSalary + totalAllowances;
```

## Usage Examples

### Setting Up Employee Allowances

#### Example 1: Employee with Multiple Allowances
```javascript
// Employee A: Has conveyance, food, and medical allowances
{
  allowances: {
    conveyance: { isActive: true, amount: 15000 },
    houseRent: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    food: { isActive: true, amount: 8000 },
    vehicleFuel: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    medical: { isActive: true, amount: 5000 },
    special: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    other: { isActive: false, amount: 0 }
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Employee with Vehicle Loan
```javascript
// Employee B: Has vehicle loan and house rent allowance
{
  allowances: {
    conveyance: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    houseRent: { isActive: true, amount: 25000 },
    food: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    vehicleFuel: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    medical: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    special: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    other: { isActive: false, amount: 0 }
  },
  loans: {
    vehicleLoan: {
      isActive: true,
      amount: 500000,
      monthlyInstallment: 15000,
      outstandingBalance: 450000
    },
    companyLoan: {
      isActive: false,
      amount: 0,
      monthlyInstallment: 0,
      outstandingBalance: 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Payroll Generation Results

#### Example Payroll Output:
```javascript
{
  employee: "employeeId",
  basicSalary: 100000,
  allowances: {
    conveyance: { isActive: true, amount: 15000 },
    houseRent: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    food: { isActive: true, amount: 8000 },
    vehicleFuel: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    medical: { isActive: true, amount: 5000 },
    special: { isActive: false, amount: 0 },
    other: { isActive: false, amount: 0 }
  },
  grossSalary: 128000, // 100000 + 15000 + 8000 + 5000
  vehicleLoanDeduction: 15000,
  companyLoanDeduction: 0,
  netSalary: 113000 // 128000 - 15000
}
```
