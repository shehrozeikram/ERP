## 💾 Database Schema

### Employee Leave Configuration
```javascript
{
  leaveConfig: {
    annualLimit: 20,       // Configurable per employee
    sickLimit: 10,         // Configurable per employee
    casualLimit: 10,       // Configurable per employee
    useGlobalDefaults: true
  },
  leaveBalance: {
    annual: {
      allocated: 20,
      used: 5,
      remaining: 15,
      carriedForward: 0,
      advance: 0           // NEW: Tracked automatically
    },
    sick: {
      allocated: 10,
      used: 12,            // More than allocated
      remaining: 0,
      carriedForward: 0,
      advance: 2           // NEW: 2 days advance
    },
    casual: { ... }
  }
}
```

### Leave Balance Collection (New)
```javascript
{
  employee: ObjectId("..."),
  year: 2025,

  updatedBy: ObjectId("...")
}
```

### Payroll Advance Details (New)
```javascript
{
  advanceLeaveDetails: {
    totalAdvanceLeaves: 2,
    annualAdvance: 0,
    sickAdvance: 2,
    casualAdvance: 0,
    advanceDeduction: 6153.85,    // 2 × 3076.92

## 🔄 Integration Flow

### 1. New Employee Creation
```
1. Employee created → leaveConfig initialized with defaults (20, 10, 10)
2. First leave access → LeaveBalance created automatically
3. useGlobalDefaults = true (can be changed per employee)
```

### 2. Leave Request → Approval → Balance Update
```
1. HR approves leave request
2. LeaveManagementService.approveLeaveRequest()
3. Calls LeaveIntegrationService.updateBalanceOnApproval()
4. Updates Employee.leaveBalance (backward compatibility)
5. Updates LeaveBalance collection
6. If used > allocated → advance calculated automatically
```

### 3. Payroll Generation with Advance Deduction
```
1. Generate payroll for month
2. PayrollService.calculateLeaveDeductions()
3. Fetches unpaid leave days from requests
4. Calls LeaveIntegrationService.calculateAdvanceLeaveDeduction()
5. Calculates: (unpaid days + advance days) × daily rate
6. Saves breakdown in payroll.advanceLeaveDetails
7. Total deduction applied to net salary
```

### 4. Employee View - Leave Management
```
1. Open Employee Detail page
2. fetchLeaveData() called automatically
3. Displays balance with advance warnings
4. HR can configure custom limits
5. Sync button reconciles from approved leaves

## 📊 Sample Data Flow

### Example: Employee with 2 Sick Advance Leaves

**Employee Leave Balance:**
```json
{
  "sick": {
    "allocated": 10,
    "used": 12,
    "remaining": 0,
    "advance": 2
  }
}
```

**Payroll Calculation:**
```javascript
Basic Salary: 80,000
Daily Rate: 80,000 / 26 = 3,076.92

Sick Advance: 2 days
Advance Deduction: 2 × 3,076.92 = 6,153.85

Total Deductions += 6,153.85
Net Salary -= 6,153.85
```

**Payroll Display:**
```
Leave Deduction: Rs. 6,153.85

Advance Leave Breakdown:
├─ Sick Advance (2 days × Rs. 3,076.92): Rs. 6,153.85
└─ Total Advance Deduction (2 days): Rs. 6,153.85

ℹ Daily Rate: Rs. 3,076.92 (Basic Salary / 26 working days)
```

```

### Advance Leave Calculation
```javascript
if (used > (allocated + carriedForward)) {
  advance = used - (allocated + carriedForward);
  remaining = 0;
} else {
  advance = 0;
  remaining = (allocated + carriedForward) - used;
}
```

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Q: Employee leave balance not showing?**
A: Click "Sync" button to initialize/recalculate balance.

**Q: Advance deduction not appearing in payroll?**
A: Ensure employee has used more leaves than allocated. Payroll must be generated after leave approval.

**Q: How to reset leave balance for new year?**
A: Use the carry-forward process or manually adjust via API endpoint.

**Q: Can I change global defaults mid-year?**
A: Yes, but only affects new employees. Existing employees keep their settings.

### Troubleshooting

**Backend Issues:**
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify employee has leaveConfig field
- Ensure LeaveBalance collection exists
- Check API endpoint permissions

**Frontend Issues:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify user has hr_manager, admin, or super_admin role
- Ensure leaveService is imported correctly
