# Anniversary-Based Leave Management System

## üéØ Overview

The Anniversary-Based Leave Management System implements individual employee leave allocation based on their work anniversary date rather than calendar year. This ensures fair and accurate leave distribution according to each employee's individual joining date.

## üìã Leave Rules

### **Annual Leaves**
- **Allocation**: 20 days per year
- **Timing**: Given **AFTER** completing 1 year of service
- **Carry Forward**: Yes, for up to 2 years
- **Expiration**: Automatically expire after 2 years

### **Sick Leaves**
- **Allocation**: 10 days per year
- **Timing**: Given from **first year** of service
- **Carry Forward**: No, renew annually
- **Expiration**: Reset to 10 on anniversary

### **Casual Leaves**
- **Allocation**: 10 days per year
- **Timing**: Given from **first year** of service
- **Carry Forward**: No, renew annually
- **Expiration**: Reset to 10 on anniversary

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **Database Schema Changes**

#### LeaveBalance Model
```javascript
{
  employee: ObjectId,
  year: Number,           // Calendar year
  workYear: Number,       // Work year (1, 2, 3...)
  expirationDate: Date,  // For annual leave expiration
  isCarriedForward: Boolean,
  annual: { allocated, used, remaining, carriedForward, advance },
  sick: { allocated, used, remaining, carriedForward, advance },
  casual: { allocated, used, remaining, carriedForward, advance }
}
```

#### LeaveRequest Model
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  leaveYear: Number,     // Calendar year
  workYear: Number,      // Work year when leave was taken
}
```

### **Core Services**

#### LeaveIntegrationService
- `calculateWorkYear(hireDate, currentDate)` - Calculate work year
- `processAnniversaryAllocation(employeeId, workYear)` - Allocate leaves for work year

- `expireOldAnnualLeaves()` - Expire annual leaves older than 2 years
- `getEmployeeAnniversaryInfo(employeeId)` - Get anniversary details
- `getWorkYearBalance(employeeId, workYear)` - Get balance for specific work year

#### AnniversaryLeaveScheduler
- **Monthly Processing**: Runs on 1st of every month at 2:00 AM
- **Tasks**:
  1. Check for work anniversaries
  2. Renew Sick/Casual leaves
  3. Allocate Annual leaves (after 1 year)
  4. Process carry forward
  5. Expire old annual leaves

## üîÑ Workflow

### **New Employee Onboarding**
1. Employee joins on `hireDate`
2. System calculates `workYear = 1`
3. Allocates: Sick (10), Casual (10), Annual (0)
4. Creates LeaveBalance record for work year 1

### **First Anniversary**
1. Employee completes 1 year
2. System calculates `workYear = 2`
3. Allocates: Sick (10), Casual (10), Annual (20)
4. Creates new LeaveBalance record for work year 2

### **Subsequent Anniversaries**
1. Employee completes another year
2. System calculates new `workYear`
3. Renews: Sick (10), Casual (10), Annual (20)
4. Carries forward unused annual leaves (max 2 years)

### **Annual Leave Expiration**
1. Monthly scheduler checks `expirationDate`
2. Expires annual leaves older than 2 years
3. Updates balance records

## üìä Examples

### **Employee Timeline**

**Employee hired: January 15, 2023**

| Date | Work Year | Annual | Sick | Casual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Jan 15, 2023 | 1 | 0 | 10 | 10 | First year - no annual leaves |
| Jan 15, 2024 | 2 | 20 | 10 | 10 | First anniversary - gets annual leaves |
| Jan 15, 2025 | 3 | 20 | 10 | 10 | Second anniversary - renewal |
| Jan 15, 2026 | 4 | 20 | 10 | 10 | Third anniversary - renewal |

### **Carry Forward Example**

**Employee with unused annual leaves:**

| Work Year | Allocated | Used | Remaining | Carried Forward |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Year 2 | 20 | 5 | 15 | 15 |
| Year 3 | 20 | 8 | 27 | 15 (from Year 2) |
| Year 4 | 20 | 10 | 30 | 15 (from Year 2) |
| Year 5 | 20 | 5 | 35 | 15 (from Year 2) |

**After 2 years (Year 5):**
- Year 2 leaves expire
- Carried forward: 0
- Total available: 20 (current year only)
