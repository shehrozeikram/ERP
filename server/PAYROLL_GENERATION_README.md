# Payroll Generation API Documentation

## Overview
The Payroll Generation API automatically creates payroll records for all active employees for a specified month and year. It implements the exact salary calculation formula as requested:

- **Gross Salary** = Basic Salary (66.66%) + Medical Allowance (10%) + House Rent (23.34%)
- **Total Earnings** = Gross Salary + All Allowances + Overtime + Bonuses
- **Income Tax** = Calculated on 90% of Total Earnings (Medical Allowance is tax-exempt)
- **Net Salary** = Total Earnings - Total Deductions

```

## Usage Examples

### Generate December 2024 Payrolls
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payroll \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "month": 12,
    "year": 2024
  }'
```

### Force Regenerate Existing Payrolls
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payroll \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "month": 12,
    "year": 2024,
    "forceRegenerate": true
  }'
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Month must be between 1-12
- Year must be 2020 or later
- Force regenerate must be boolean

### Business Logic Errors
- Payrolls already exist (unless forceRegenerate=true)
- No active employees found
- Employee salary information missing

## Testing

Use the provided test script:
```bash
node test-payroll-generation.js
```

Make sure to:
1. Update the `AUTH_TOKEN` in the test script
2. Have the server running on port 5000
3. Have active employees with salary information in the database

## Database Requirements

### Employee Model
- `employmentStatus`: Must be 'Active'
- `salary.gross`: Must exist and be > 0
- `allowances`: Optional additional allowances

### Payroll Model
- Automatically creates all required fields
- Sets status to 'Draft'
- Includes audit fields (createdBy, timestamps)

## Security

- **Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
- **Authorization**: Admin or HR Manager only
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Audit**: All actions logged with user information

## Performance Considerations

- Processes employees sequentially to avoid memory issues
- Includes error handling for individual employee failures
- Provides detailed logging for debugging
- Returns comprehensive summary statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Payrolls already exist"**
   - Use `forceRegenerate: true` to overwrite existing payrolls

2. **"No active employees found"**
   - Check employee employment status and salary information

3. **Tax calculation errors**
   - Verify employee salary data is numeric and positive

4. **Database connection issues**
   - Check MongoDB connection and authentication

### Debug Logging

The API provides extensive console logging:
- Employee processing status
- Salary calculations
- Tax calculations
- Summary statistics

Check server console for detailed information during execution.
