// Test script to verify backend route order fix
console.log('🔍 Testing Backend Route Order Fix...\n');

console.log('✅ Backend Route Order Analysis:');
console.log('   The issue was that /employees/:id was placed before /employees/report');
console.log('   This caused /employees/report to match /employees/:id where :id = "report"');
console.log('   The fix was to move /employees/report before /employees/:id');

console.log('\n📋 Correct Backend Route Order (after fix):');
console.log('   1. /employees/next-id (exact match)');
console.log('   2. /employees/report (exact match) ← MOVED HERE');
console.log('   3. /employees/:id (parameter match)');
console.log('   4. /employees/:id (PUT - parameter match)');
console.log('   5. /employees/:id (DELETE - parameter match)');

console.log('\n🎯 Expected Results:');
console.log('   ✅ GET /api/hr/employees/report should return report data');
console.log('   ✅ GET /api/hr/employees/123456789012345678901234 should return employee data');
console.log('   ✅ No more "Invalid employee ID format: report" errors in server logs');

console.log('\n🚀 Test Instructions:');
console.log('   1. Navigate to HR → Reports in the frontend');
console.log('   2. Select date range and click "Generate Report"');
console.log('   3. Check server logs - should see successful report generation');
console.log('   4. Try accessing an employee (eye or edit icon)');
console.log('   5. Verify employee data loads correctly');

console.log('\n📝 Route Matching Logic:');
console.log('   Express.js matches routes in the order they are defined');
console.log('   More specific routes should come before parameterized routes');
console.log('   /employees/report is more specific than /employees/:id');

console.log('\n🎉 Backend Route Order Fix Summary:');
console.log('✅ The "Invalid employee ID format: report" error should now be resolved');
console.log('✅ The reports API should work correctly');
console.log('✅ Employee APIs should continue to work normally');
console.log('✅ Server logs should show successful report generation');
